Description: Implements an extension of the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) statistic for
    survival data, sGBJ. It computes the sGBJ statistic and its p-value for testing 
    the association between a gene set and a time-to-event outcome with possible 
    adjustment on additional covariates. Detailed method is available at Villain L, Ferte T, 
    Thiebaut R and Hejblum BP (2021) <doi:10.1101/2021.09.07.459329>.
